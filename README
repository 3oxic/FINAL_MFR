1.1 What did you build

I Have Build an apache storm topology, were it monitor sensors.
I assume that I have a stream of sensors data with temperatures.
The spout will read this values and will emit them into the topology.
Bolt is doing the filtering ( if the temperature is higher than 100)

2.2 What  technology did you choose

I chose Apache Storm. It is made for real-time stream proccessing. You can have a stream of many tuples incoming to the topology and it process them in real time.
2.3 How can we install the framework of your choice to run your code?

1.Download Apache Storm
2.Move the tar into /usr/local
3.Untar Apache Storm ( tar -xzf [STORM_TAR])
4.Rename the untarred folder into /usr/local/storm (sudo mv [STORM_FOLDER] /usr/local/storm or just storm) 
5.Do the same with zookeeper, (install,move into /usr/local, tar -xzf [ZOOKEEPER_TAR], sudo mv [ZOOKEEPER_FOLDER] /usr/local/zookeeper or just zookeeper)
6. export the bin folders of zookeper and storm into ~/.bashrc
 export ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX=/usr/local/zookeeper
 export PATH=$PATH:$ZOOKEEPER_PREFIX/bin

 export STORM_PREFIX=/usr/local/storm
 export PATH=$PATH:$STORM_PREFIX/bin
7. sudo ldconfig
8. cd /usr/local/zookeeper/conf
9. vi zoo.cfg
10. Paste this:
tickTime=2000
initLimit=10
syncLimit=5
dataDir=/usr/local/zookeeper
clientPort=2181

We can now start the zookeeper server with this command: (zkServer is located in /usr/local/zookeeper/bin)
zkServer.sh start

11. sudo vi /usr/local/storm/conf/storm.yaml
12. Paste this:

#Zookeeper configuration file
 yaml storm.zookeeper.servers:
 - "localhost"
 yaml storm.local.dir: "/usr/local/storm"
 yaml nimbus.host: "localhost"
 yaml supervisor.slots.ports:
 - 6700 - 6701 - 6702 - 6703

Perfect, we can now start apache storm:
cd /usr/local/storm/bin/
./storm nimbus & ./storm supervisor & ./storm ui

we can now go to localhost and see apache storm running


2.4 What was hard about building your application?
To be honest it was not that hard building the application but what was hard is  doing the whole setup correctly.
Also it took me a little bit to understand the basic concept of apache storm (saw from the slides Spout, Bolt, Topology etc.)

2.5 What did you think was intuitive about the API/SDK that you used?

Its easy to make a topology as long as you understand the concept. All you have to do is to override some functions. At the end the code looks very clear.

2.6 Why do you think the developers made the API/SDK the way they did?

I think you can easily integrate it with other tools such as apache kafka and elasticsearch. It does not need many modifications.

2.7 What changes would you make to the API/SDK to improve it?

If I had to do something for improvement I would make an IDE in which you could build your topology as long as run it.

2.8 What did you learn in the process of building your application?

I have learned how to make apache storm topologies as well as I understood basic concepts behind apache storm.

2.9 What was most surprising?

I opened more than one spout, just because I was curious how well will apache storm perform. I was opening more and more spouts(3 spouts in total) spamming into the topology  and it did pretty well.
